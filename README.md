## Pre-requisites

### CASA

Please use CASA with ALMA pipeline. I am using `CASA version 6.6.1-17-pipeline-2024.1.0.8`.

### CASA Modules

Please install [analysisUtilites](https://zenodo.org/records/17252072).
I strongly recommend you to use the **LATEST** version of it.

## Installation

You can install this package by

```shell
pip install almaqso
```

Then you can use the package like this:

```python
import almaqso
```

## Usage

See sample code in `sample` folder and [documentation](https://akimasanishida.github.io/almaqso/).

## Developer Guide

I recommend you to use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage everything.
After installing CASA and analysisUtils shown in Pre-requisites section, please install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

Then, you can reproduce the environment by

```shell
uv sync --dev
```

You can run `main.py` or something with

```shell
uv run main.py  # or something
```
